# Workation-PricePrediction
The Workation Trip Price Prediction project aims to solve the challenge of finding the best workation packages by predicting the cost per person for a workation trip based on various factors such as location, hotel type, itinerary, and other amenities. With over 18,000 rows of data containing details about different travel packages across India, the project utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a workation package. The goal is to help individuals and teams find the most suitable and affordable workation options, offering a balance of work and recreation in serene locations with amenities like high-speed internet and comfortable stays. The model leverages factors like destination, accommodation type, and itinerary details to provide accurate and cost-effective recommendations.
